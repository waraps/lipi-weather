## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with yarn, so its use is recommended.

go to the project root, open a terminal, and run the  command.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run app

### first

You must create a file called `.env` in the root of the directory and then copy the values â€‹â€‹that are inside the `.env.example` file.

NOTE: inside of new `.env` file, you must change the value for the variable `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_KEY` for you own Open Weather Map API key to ensure that the app works

### then

```bash
yarn start
``` 
### and finally

If you want to test on a `mobile device` you should ensure that the Expo Go app is installed on the device, so you should open the Expo Go app and then scan the QR code showed in  the terminal to init Lipiweather app.

If you want to test the `web version`, you should type the `w` word in the terminal and wait for the browser to open the app.
